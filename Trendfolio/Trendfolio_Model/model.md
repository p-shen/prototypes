Candidate Selection / Primary Selection
==================
**Selection Criteria**

Market:
*	Recognizable brand name, hard for competitors to take away market share (eg. Coca-Cola)
*	Products are simple to understand for investors (eg. food, diapers, razors)

Management:
*	Lengthy history of steady earnings growth, or in most cases, increasing earnings pers share each year for past 10 years
*	Exception to above: EPS can be negative or sharp loss in recent year but long-term earnings history is solid to signal good time to buy in
*	Managable debt - able to pay off debt within five eyars based on current earnings. (Great: enough annual earnings that they can use to pay off all debt in two years or less, if needed)
*	Return on equity and return on total capital (ROE of at least 15% and ROTC of at least 12% over past 10 years and 3 years)
*	Retained earnings spending (earnings not paid out in dividends) - amount of EPS increase per past decade / total amount of retained earnings over past decade, eg. how well the retained earnings are used to generate profit. 12% or more

Price Prediction (ML Strategies core concepts):
*	Compare initial expected yield to long-term treasury yeild (is it higher than the safe T-Bill?)
*	Use historical ROE and EPS
*	"If the company is one of sufficient earning power and earns high rates of return on shareholder's equity, created by some kind of consumer monopoly, chances are good that accurate long-term projections of earnings can be made."
*	"Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when other are fearful", buying windows based on recent downdraft?
